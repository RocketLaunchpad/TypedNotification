    /**
     Register a block to be executed when the specified `TypedNotification` type is posted.

     The API works like `NotificationCenter.addObserver(forName:object:queue:using:)`. Note that the returned `NotificationToken` must be retained. Once it is deallocated, the observer is deregistered.

     If the closure passed to this function references `self`, you must add `[weak self]` to the closure's capture list.

     Example:

     ```
     struct MyNotification: TypedNotification { ... }

     class MyViewController: UIViewController {
         private var notificationToken: NotificationToken?

         override func viewDidLoad() {
             super.viewDidLoad()

             notificationToken = NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(for: MyNotification.self) { [weak self] (notification) in
             self?.received(notification)
             }
         }

         private func received(_ notification: MyNotification) {
             ...
         }
     }
     ```

     In the example, `MyViewController` retains the `NotificationToken` returned by `NotificationCenter.addObserver()`. When the `MyViewController` instance is deallocated, the `NotificationToken` is deallocated and the observer is deregistered. The `[weak self]` capture list is important. Without it, there will be a retain cycle.

     - Parameters:
         - for: the `TypedNotification` subtype
         - object: The object from which you want to receive notifications. Pass `nil` to receive all notifications.
         - queue: The queue on which to execute the block. Per `NotificationCenter` documentation, if you pass `nil`, the block is run synchronously on the posting thread.
         - block: The block to be executed when the notification is received. The block takes a single instance of the `type` as an argument.

     - Returns:
         A `NotificationToken` object. The observer is automatically deregistered when this token object is deallocated, so be sure to retain a reference to it.
